## The Problem

Subjects were asked to draw a line from point A to point B. Since they usually did not set off from A exactly, but rather from somewhere in its vicinity, the question arose how to handle this uncertainty when attempting to quantify the complexity of the line between A and B.

To estimate a distribution of the actual starting points across all trials in a subject, the mean and standard deviation of the starting point y-coordinates were used to calculate the coefficient of variation (CoV; [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_variation)). The y-coordinates of the digitizing tablet run from 0 to **XXXX**, and the the starting point A is in the middle of the y-axis. 

## Possible Solutions

### 'A' is Set to Zero

The most natural or intuitive solution would be to set A to zero, so that starting points of actual trajectories above A have positive y-coordinates, and ones below A are negative. Subjects who, for whatever reason, tend to start above (or below) A therefore would have a positive (negative) mean of starting point y-coordinates.

Systematic deviation of actual starting points from the 'true' starting point A implies a systematic limit for exploration on one side of the middle line, but since the systematic deviations from A are rather small compared to the range of the y-axis, this should be negligible.
